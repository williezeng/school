Here is a collection of my most notable class project of my time at Georgia Tech


Machine Learning Summary:
- Analyzed and avoided verfitted data on Logistic Regression, PCA, SVMs, KNN, and NNs, and bagging and boosting techniques
- Measured results with loss functions and gradient descent



Deep Learning Summary:
- Constructed and Compared multiple neural networks 
- explored different optimizatoin techniques and preprocessing techniques
- Worked with 3 students to research, experiment, and document on a linear regression, fully connected and recurring neural network model
- The fully connected neural network classified malicious PowerShell scripts with 98.8% accuracy
